# 🎤 SpeakSense AI  
### Multimodal AI-Powered Speaking Performance Analyzer

SpeakSense AI is an end-to-end multimodal system that evaluates speaking performance from recorded videos using **Computer Vision, Audio Signal Processing, and NLP**.

The system extracts structured features from visual presence, vocal delivery, and language quality, then generates a quantified performance score with improvement insights.

## 🚀 What It Does

Upload a speaking video → AI analyzes:

- 🎥 **Visual Signals**  
  Posture stability, eye contact, gesture frequency, facial confidence  

- 🎙️ **Vocal Delivery**  
  Words per minute, pitch variation, pause detection, volume consistency  

- 🧠 **Language Quality**  
  Filler words, vocabulary richness, lexical diversity, sentence structure  

Outputs:
- Visual Score  
- Vocal Score  
- Language Score  
- Overall Speaking Score  
- Structured JSON performance report

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

- Integrates **CV + Audio ML + NLP** in one system  
- Feature-engineered, explainable scoring logic  
- Modular backend architecture  
- Designed for scalability and SaaS deployment  
- Demonstrates full AI pipeline integration  

This project showcases real-world AI engineering beyond isolated model training.
